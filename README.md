# HTML-Data-Grabber

Made an implementation to grab our universities dining points from the website. There
is no username or password implementation but it can be easily implemented. It is meant
for a friend of mine's app that he is creating for our school. It basically grabs the amount
of dining dollars you have left and returns it, it also auto signs into the WebView.
